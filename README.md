group assignment, Java version

Parts to be completed:
  1. Console commands to run program and designate input/output files [NOT DONE / Scott]
  2. Read and parse data from file [DONE(needs testing) / Jacky]
      - make sure to store each section as appropriate data types
      - check any possible errors at this stage
  3. Hard constraints [NOT DONE / Khalid]
      - put forced pairs into final list of constructed pairs
      - make list of forbidden pairs (based on forbidden machines and too-near tasks)
  4. Soft constraints [NOT DONE / Fungai]
      - algorithm to check for lowest value for each machine (including machine penalties and too-near penalties)
      - add pair to final list of constructed pairs
  5. Output file with proper format [NOT DONE / Scott]
  6. JUnit testing [NOT DONE / Oliver]
      - multiple test cases to ensure program catches any possible set of conditions
