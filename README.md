# CPSC449_jkfso_Java
group assignment, Java version

Parts to be completed:
  1. Console commands to run program and designate input/output files [DONE / Scott]
  2. Read and parse data from file [DONE(needs testing) / Jacky]
      - make sure to store each section as appropriate data types
      - check any possible errors at this stage
  3. Hard constraints [DONE / Khalid & Scott]
      - put forced pairs into final list of constructed pairs
      - make list of forbidden pairs (based on forbidden machines and too-near tasks)
      - check if violates too-near for each new pair [NOT DONE]
  4. Soft constraints [DONE / Fungai & Jacky]
      - algorithm to check for lowest value for each machine (including machine penalties and too-near penalties)
      - add pair to final list of constructed pairs
  5. Output file with proper format [DONE / Scott]
  6. JUnit testing [DONE / Oliver]
      - multiple test cases to ensure program catches any possible set of conditions
